# Lending-Club-Loan-Default-Prediction
**The goal of the project is to predict whether or not a customer will default on their loan. The dataset used for this project was hosted on Kaggle by Lending Club.**

- **Performed exploratory data analysis in Python on a data set consisting of 400,00 rows, using statistical analysis and visualization.Performed feature engineering by extracting information from existing attributes. For example, we extracted the zipcode from the address attribute.**
- **Dealt with missing values in the data by imputing or dropping data.**
- **Built an artificial neural network using early stopping to prevent model over-fitting to make predictions on the target variable.**
- **Made predictions with an accuracy of around 89 percent.**
